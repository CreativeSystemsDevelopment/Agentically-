## Current Status

⚠️ **Note**: All repository directories currently exist as **empty placeholders**. The actual repository content has not yet been populated. This structure is designed to eventually house complete clones of each project with their full commit history and content.

## Portal Directory

**Status**: Not yet created

The portal directory is planned as a future platform component that will:
- Bridge user interaction with the various agent repositories
- Provide a unified interface for accessing and managing different agent frameworks
- Enable cross-repository workflows and integrations

## Repository Categories Summary

| Category | Count | Projects |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Python Frameworks** | 2 | agent-zero, agent-framework |
| **TypeScript/JavaScript SDKs** | 3 | copilot-sdk_ml_platform, openclaw, claude-agent-sdk-demos |
| **Community Resources** | 1 | awesome-copilot |
| **Total Projects** | 6 | - |

## Technology Stack

- **Languages**: Python, TypeScript, JavaScript
- **License**: Primarily MIT (where specified)
- **Focus Areas**: AI Agents, Automation, SDK Development, Community Resources

## Future Plans
